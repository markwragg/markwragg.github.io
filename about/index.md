~ I live in the South East of the UK with my wife, three children, Labrador and two cats. I have been working in IT Engineering roles since graduating with a Degree in Computing in 2003. Much of my initial career was working in front-line operations roles, supporting infrastructure and SaaS applications hosted in private datacentres and the cloud. For the past 3 years I've been working as a DevOps Engineer and more recently via the contract market. My experience is predominantly with Microsoft technologies but I can generally turn a quick hand to any new tool and I have worked previously with both AWS and Azure as well as a variety of DevOps toolsets.

You can follow me on Twitter [@markwragg](https://twitter.com/markwragg).

I am particularly passionate about PowerShell and have spoken twice at [PSDay.UK](https://psday.uk/), the UK's annual PowerShell Conference. If you'd like to view my talks they can be found here:

#### Public Speaking

- [Measure all the things with Influx, Grafana and PowerShell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7PYt9tWFw8) *-- PSDay Birmingham 2019*
- [Mastering PowerShell Testing with Pester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbOiQCgDDR8&feature=youtu.be) *-- PSDay London 2018*
- [How to Develop Cross-Platform Compatible Modules using PowerShell Code](https://github.com/markwragg/Presentations/tree/master/20180925_Southampton-PSUG) *-- Southampton PowerShell Usergroup 2018 (slides only, not recorded)*

#### Books

I have also made contributions to the following books:

- [The PowerShell Conference Book volume 1](https://leanpub.com/powershell-conference-book) *-- contributed a chapter on PowerShell code testing with Pester*
- [The PowerShell Conference Book volume 2](https://leanpub.com/psconfbook2) *-- contributed a chapter on monitoring with Influx, Grafana and PowerShell*

#### Open Source

I maintain a number of Open Source code repositories for tools that I've developed that I felt could be useful to the wider community. You can find those in my profile on [GitHub](https://github.com/markwragg). Some that are particularly popular include:

- [PowerShell-Influx](https://github.com/markwragg/PowerShell-Influx) *-- a PowerShell module for sending metrics into the time-series platform Influx.*
- [Test-ActiveDirectory](https://github.com/markwragg/Test-ActiveDirectory) *-- a set of Pester tests for validating the health of a deployment of Active Directory.*
- [PowerShell-SlackBot](https://github.com/markwragg/Powershell-SlackBot) *-- a PowerShell module for hosting a chat bot for Slack using PowerShell and TCP Sockets. The chat bot can then be configured to listen to and respond to specific messages and run PowerShell commands that are initiated from within a chat window.*
