title: Azure Containers
---
Microsoft Azure has two container services:

- [Azure Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/overview/containers/) (generally available [since April 2016](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-container-service-is-now-generally-available/)  â€“ you can also use Kubernetes as an orchestrator)
- [Azure Container Service - AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/container-service/) (preview) - also known as container services (managed) is a dedicated managed Kubernetes service, in preview since Oct 2017
There are also the following services:

- [Container Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups) (preview) - a top level resource for Azure Container instances. A container group is a collection of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine. They share a lifecycle, local network and storage volumes.
- [Container Registries](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/container-registry/) - a private docker registry to store and manage container images.
- [Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/container-instances/) (preview) - a service for easily running containers without needing to worry about orchestration. I think this service is aimed at testing/development.

# Azure Container Service

- Available in all regions
- The master Kubernetes machines are exposed to you in the Azure portal and are yours to manage (and pay for).

# Azure Container Service (AKS)
- Kubernetes as a service. Currently in preview
- Only available in the East US and Central US regions
- The master Kubernetes machines are a managed service grouped and referred to as the "Hosted Control Plane". You still control if/when Kubernetes version is upgraded (which can be done without downtime) but you aren't having to otherwise pay for or manage the management machines.
- Only pay for the virtual machines instances, storage and networking resources consumed by your Kubernetes cluster.
- Azure Container Service is a free service, therefore it does not have a financially backed SLA. However, for the availability of underlying virtual machines, the Virtual Machine SLA applies.
