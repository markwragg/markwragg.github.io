I got started with PowerShell thanks to the encouragement and enthusiasm of a [friend and former colleague](http://sammart.in). Following that, I've largely developed my knowledge through the standard combinations of trial + error + googling and more recently (as is evident) by doing my best to engage with and give back to the community.

[![XKCD: Code Quality](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/code_quality.png)](https://xkcd.com/1513/)

When I meet people who are new to PowerShell and they ask me to advise them on [resources to help them get started](http://wragg.io/getting-started-with-powershell/) I often mention the [Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-windows-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches-third-edition) book (which recently released as a 3rd edition) mostly because I've seen it recommended by others in the community. However I personally had not read it and that seemed.. well.. wrong.

Equally it may seem a little bizarre that I read it now, but what I found was doing so helped me to confirm some things I knew (which has given me more confidence when attempting to explain them to others) and has clarified some things I was murky about. It also taught me a few things I didn't know at all and I was surprised (and impressed) by the depth and inclusion of some topics which I didn't expect in a book (I always assumed is) aimed at beginners.

*-- When I put together the original list of topics I wanted to cover (see below)  I decided it was too long for a single blog post. I also found that they fell in to four broad topics and so to make things more specific for future googlers, each major topic is getting a blog post of it's own which I will link to when they are ready.*

Without further ado, here are some things I learnt from reading Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches (#TILFMOL):

- #1 [The PowerShell Pipeline](http://wragg.io/tilfmol1-the-powershell-pipeline/)
  - How pipeline input knows where to go
  - If you can't get input to a parameter via the pipeline, there is another way
  - One script one pipeline
- #2 [PowerShell Help](http://wragg.io/tilfmol-2-powershell-help/)
  - Help vs Get-Help
  - The meaning of square brackets in help:
     - Optional/Positional Parameters
     - Array Input
- #3 [PowerShell Remoting](http://wragg.io/tilfmol-3-powershell-remoting/)
  - Executing remote commands on one or many machines
  - Deserialised objects are the result of commands
  - Creating Endpoints
- #4 [PowerShell Jobs](http://wragg.io/tilfmol-4-powershell-jobs/)
  - Local/background jobs
  - Executing remote jobs with `Invoke-Command`
  - Scheduled jobs

Happily, I can now confidently and personally recommend [Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-windows-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches-third-edition), not only for beginners but to anyone looking to validate and further their knowledge of PowerShell.
